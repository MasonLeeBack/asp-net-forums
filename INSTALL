Assumptions:
You have installed Mono 1.0 (probably from Red Carpet or rpm)
Specific packages include (plus dependencies):
	mono-core
        mono-web-forms
	mono-data-postgresql
	mono-remoting
	xsp

You have installed mod_mono 1.0

Have postgres installed 

Need to have plpgsql registered in template1; otherwise, use included install script (plpgsql.sql) to install into template1 or into the aspnetforums db after completing the INSTALL steps.

1) As root, install the database "aspnetforums":

        sudo ./init.sh

2) Ensure that the postgres application user (aspnetforumsuser above) can connect through tcpip

	a) Enable tcpip in postgresql.conf *  (This is probably the first setting in the file, just change it from false to true and uncomment it)

		tcpip_socket = true

	b) In pg_hba.conf *, add this line for the least priveleged settings for the app to connect (where aspnetforumsuser is the user created in the step above)

		host    aspnetforums    aspnetforumsuser    127.0.0.1    255.255.255.255    password

* In Red Hat 9 / Fedora Core 1, these files are located in /var/lib/pgsql/data/

3)  Restart postgres

4)  Configure apache in httpd.conf * (If you've ran anything in mod_mono, you've probably done most of this...)

	a)  Add these lines (setting mono to handle requests to your application):

MonoApplications "/aspnetforums:/your/application/root"
<Directory /your/application/root>
        SetHandler mono
</Directory>

	b)  Add this line to reference the application root

		Alias /aspnetforums "/your/application/root"

	c)  Ensure that Default.aspx is in the DirectoryIndex 

		DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var default.aspx

* In Red Hat 9 / Fedora Core 1, this file is located in /etc/httpd/conf/


5)  Build the Components
	a) # You only need to make the "Engine" project in order to build the AspNetForums.dll that will be consumed by the forums web application. From the command line in the AspNetForums/Engine directory, execute:
   [ Engine]$ 	make 	  
# Copy the resulting AspNetForums.dll from the AspNetForums/Engine directory to the Web Application bin (AspNetForums/AspNetForums/bin/). Execute:
   [ Engine]$ 	cp bin/Debug/AspNetForums.dll ../AspNetForums/bin/ 	  

6)  Restart Apache


7)  Edit Web.config and change "yourpassword" in the connectionString in the AppSettings section to your aspnetforumsuser user password.

8)  It may be necessary to restart mono (mod_mono server) after doing the build

	a) killall mono
